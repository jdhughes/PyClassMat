To run the functions (more detailed instructions to follow!) run:

NWIS_read_driver.py

The first variable "testCase" determines the behavior. 

if testCase == 1: this runs a bunch of little functions that are later
	used by the full program. To run an NWIS query, we need something called
	a FIPS number for the state and the county. This code does the lookup
	for county = "DANE" and state = "WISCONSIN".

if testCase == 2: this runs the entire dealio including running all the subfunctions
	to get the FIPS codes, prompting the user for all the input arguments, querying
	NWIS, parsing the results, and plotting up hydrographs.
	If using testCase==2, no need to set any variables ahead of time -- all will be 
	prompted for.
